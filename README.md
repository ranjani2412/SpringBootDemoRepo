# SpringBootDemoRepo
This is a starter SpringBoot project created from an Initializr that touches basics with some code comments on auto-configuration.

Points covered
1. @SpringBootApplication - responsible to create the spring context and autoconfigure beans, DB, servlets etc
2. @ComponentScan - scan the beans to map them as a REST service using @REST Controller
